# Problem

- Given an array nums of size **n**, return the **majority element**.

- The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

# Solution

Use Unorder map and find which element is occuring more than n/2 times.
