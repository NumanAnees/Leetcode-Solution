## Solution

### Constraints:

- O(1) extra space
- nums[] contain only 0, 1 and 2

### Algorithm:

- Consider three pointers low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.size() - 1
- The algorithm ensures that at any point, every element before low is 0, every element after high is 2, every element in between are either 0, 1 or 2 i.e. unprocessed.
- We'll use mid pointer to traverse and check the array elements i.e. while(mid <= high). Three cases are possible:
  - nums[mid] == 0 In this case swap(nums[low], nums[mid]) and increment both low and mid pointer i.e. low++ mid++
  - nums[mid] == 1 In this case mid++
  - nums[mid] == 2 In this case swap(nums[mid], nums[high]) and decrement high pointer i.e. high--

### Example:

- Consider nums[] = [0 1 1 0 1 2 1]
- Iteration 1:
  - low = 0, mid = 0, high = 6
  - nums[mid] == 0
  - swap(nums[low++], nums[mid++]
  - [0 1 1 0 1 2 1]
- Iteration 2:
  - low = 1, mid = 1, high = 6
  - nums[mid] == 1
  - mid++
  - [0 1 1 0 1 2 1]
- Iteration 3:
  - low = 1, mid = 2, high = 6
  - nums[mid] == 1
  - mid++
  - [0 1 1 0 1 2 1]
- Iteration 4:
  - low = 1, mid = 3, high = 6
  - nums[mid] == 0
  - swap(nums[low++], nums[mid++]
  - [0 0 1 1 1 2 1]
- Iteration 5:
  - low = 2, mid = 4, high = 6
  - nums[mid] == 1
  - mid++
  - [0 0 1 1 1 2 1]
- Iteration 6:
  - low = 2, mid = 5, high = 6
  - nums[mid] == 2
  - swap(nums[mid], nums[high--]
  - [0 0 1 1 1 1 2]
- Iteration 7:
  - low = 2, mid = 5, high = 5
  - nums[mid] == 1
  - mid++
  - [0 0 1 1 1 1 2]
- Iteration 8:
  - low = 2, mid = 6, high = 5
  - mid > high
  - Exit the loop
