# Problem

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

## Example :

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

```

# Solution

Use two pointer approach and move non zero elements to the left.

# Dry Run ...?
