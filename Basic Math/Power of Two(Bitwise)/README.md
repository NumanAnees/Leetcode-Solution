## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/

## Solution

```
Let's take some good exampes :
number->binary form
3->0000 0011
4->0000 0100
5->0000 0101
6->0000 0110
7->0000 0111
8->0000 1000
```

The observation we can conclude is that the number which is a power of two has always compulsoryily 1 true bit.

```
Now consider :-
bit representation of 7  -> 0111
bit representation of 8  -> 1000
bitwise AND of 7 and 8 -> 0000
we are gonna use this property for for all numbers which are powers of two
```
